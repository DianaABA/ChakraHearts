# Chakra Hearts â€” Episode 1 (Sprite-Reduced Edition)
**File:** `episode1_script_CINEMATIC.md`  
**Change request:** Use only **Neutral/Smile/Angry** portraits for *human* characters (David, Elena, MC), and **only one Neutral** sprite each for **Agnivesh (Panther)** and **Santi (Serpent)**. Non-portrait cinematic/wide assets remain unchanged.

---

## Sprite Rules Applied
- **Humans:** `*_neutral_root`, `*_smile_root`, `*_angry_root` only.
- **Agnivesh (Panther):** `agnivesh_panther_neutral` only.
- **Santi (Serpent):** `santi_serpent_neutral` only.
- Replaced former portrait IDs like `david_concerned_root`, `david_warm_rare_smile_root`, `elena_playful_root`, etc., with the closest of the three moods.
- Replaced aspect-form portrait calls in SC5 Vision to their **neutral** forms.
- Added a tiny **portrait resolver** to keep calls concise where helpful.
